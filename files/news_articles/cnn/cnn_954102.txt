A winter storm causing chaos on a busy travel weekend brought more high winds, snow and rain Monday as it pushed from the Midwest toward the Great Lakes and into the northeast US.
More than 1,300 flights within, into or out of the US were canceled Monday, according to FlightAware.com. Chicago's O'Hare International Airport was hit particularly hard, with more than 800 flight cancellations and delays averaging more than 40 minutes because of heavy snowfall.
