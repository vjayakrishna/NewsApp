Hoover police can't seem to get their story straight on why an officer killed a man at an Alabama mall. 
First, they said a 21-year-old suspect shot and wounded two other people. Then they said Emantic Bradford didn't pull the trigger, but brandished a gun. Now we've learned Bradford didn't necessarily do that, either.
