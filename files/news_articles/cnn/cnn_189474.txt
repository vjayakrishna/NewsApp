Ariana Grande released a sneak peek of her music video for "Thank U, Next" and it's full of delicious throwbacks. 
The clip shared by Grande on Instagram early Tuesday features the singer dressed as Regina George from the 2004 film "Mean Girls." Jonathan Bennett, who played Aaron Samuels in the film, and Stefanie Drummond, who played Bethany Byrd, make cameos.
