Courtroom sketch artists at the trial of alleged drug kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman were barred from drawing the facial features or distinguishing hairstyle of a key witness on Monday. 
In addition, the artists were required to show the sketches to government prosecutors for approval before they could be distributed, the judge in the federal trial said.
