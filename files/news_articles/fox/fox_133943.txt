NEW YORK – The holiday shopping season has gotten off to a "very strong" start, according to the largest U.S. retail trade group.
The National Retail Federation said Tuesday that consumer spending has been strong, fueled by a better economy and stores' investments in online services including features that allow shoppers to buy online and pick up the items at the store.
The trade group's assessment comes even after a survey of more than 3,000 shoppers Thanksgiving and Friday forecast that fewer people would turn out for the five-day weekend that ended Monday, compared to a year ago.
