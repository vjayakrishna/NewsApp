WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's national security adviser on Tuesday defended his decision not to listen to an audio recording of the killing of a Saudi journalist, saying he chose not to listen because he doesn't speak Arabic.
"What am I going to learn from &#x2014; if they were speaking Korean, I wouldn't learn any more from it either," John Bolton told journalists at a White House briefing. Bolton added he was able to get all the information he needed by reading a transcript of the recording.
"People who speak Arabic have listened to the tape and they have given us the substance of what's in it," Bolton said. When pressed on the issue, Bolton said he believed he has a full understanding of what is on the audio recording. "I'm very satisfied that we know what the tape picked up and it was factored into the president's decision and he's announced his position very clearly," he said.
