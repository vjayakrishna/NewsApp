THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. – The number of victims in a shooting at a Southern California country music bar this month could have been much higher based on the amount of ammunition the gunman carried, investigators said Tuesday.
Authorities said they were no closer to figuring out why Ian David Long killed 12 people on Nov. 7 at the Borderline Bar and Grill but revealed that he left behind more than 150 bullets when he fatally shot himself.
There is no evidence Long was radicalized or was targeting an ex-girlfriend at the bar in the Los Angeles suburb of Thousand Oaks, investigators said at the first news conference since the week of the shooting. Officials previously said they were looking into the possibility he was targeting her.
