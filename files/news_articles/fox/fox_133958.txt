BEIJING – Lu Guang's photos exposed the everyday realities of people on the margins of Chinese society: coal miners, drug addicts, HIV patients.
Now, the award-winning photographer is at the center of his own stark story. He was taken away by state security agents three weeks ago for unknown reasons, Lu's wife, Xu Xiaoli, told The Associated Press late Tuesday.
Xu said Lu was traveling in Xinjiang on Nov. 3 when she lost contact with him. He had connected with photographers in Urumqi, the capital, one week before and was scheduled to meet a friend in Sichuan province on Nov. 5, but he never showed up.
