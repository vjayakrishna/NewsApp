Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort suggested on Tuesday in a statement obtained by Fox News that he might bring legal action against The Guardian, after the newspaper published what he called a "totally false and deliberately libelous" report claiming that he met with Wikileaks head Julian Assange the same month he joined the Trump team.
Shortly afterwards, Wikileaks posted on Twitter that "Assange has instructed his lawyers to sue the Guardian for libel over fabricated Manafort story and launched a legal fund to boost the action."
Manafort, who was convicted on unrelated tax and banking-fraud charges brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller earlier this year, unequivocally denied any connection to the secretive organization.
