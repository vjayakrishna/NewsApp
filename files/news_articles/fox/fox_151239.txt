The adult children of a former Chinese businessman on the run for a multi-million fraud scheme have been barred from returning to the United States despite not being under investigation, the U.S. State Department confirmed to Fox News.
A spokesperson said Tuesday that Victor and Cynthia Liu have been prevented from leaving China since June 2018 because of local officials&#x2019; use of an exit ban.
&#x201C;We routinely have shared our concern about China&#x2019;s use of exit bans on American citizens with the Chinese government and will continue to do so until we see a transparent and fair process,&#x201D; the spokesperson told Fox News.
