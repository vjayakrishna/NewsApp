After winning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for playing the role of Anita in 1961's West Side Story, EGOT winner Rita Moreno will return to the next big screen adaptation of the Leonard Bernstein-Stephen Sondheim lyric musical which Oscar-winner Steven Spielberg is directing. In addition, Moreno will also be an executive producer of the film.
In the new "West Side Story," Moreno will be playing Valentina, a re-conceived and expanded version of the character of Doc, the owner of the corner store in which Tony works. Filming for West Side Story is set to begin in the summer of 2019.
"Never in my wildest dreams did I see myself revisiting this seminal work," says Moreno. "And to be asked by Steven Spielberg to participate is simply thrilling!  Then to work together with the brilliant playwright, Tony Kushner &#x2013; what a glorious stew! I am tingling!"
