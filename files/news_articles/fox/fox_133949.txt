CNN&#x2019;s Jim Acosta made his return to the James S. Brady room on Tuesday for a press briefing with Sarah Sanders -- 20 days after the reporter was temporarily banned from the White House.
Sanders, who until Tuesday hadn't held a briefing in weeks, took questions after sessions with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and National Security Adviser John Bolton &#x2013; during which Acosta kept quiet. The press secretary eventually called on Acosta, who asked if President Trump would recommend that Paul Manafort should cooperate with authorities going forward.
The questioning grew tenser -- though not nearly as explosive as the post-election incident that resulted in his pass being pulled -- as Acosta then asked why Trump doesn&#x2019;t have faith in his advisers, citing the president's apparent skepticism toward a major government climate change study and the CIA's findings regarding Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's role in activist Jamal Khashoggi's killing.
