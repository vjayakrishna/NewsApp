A Pennsylvania judge ordered the commonwealth's former attorney general to report to prison by 9 a.m. Thursday, more than two years after she was convicted for leaking grand jury information and lying about it.
Democrat Kathleen Kane, 52, had been free on $75,000 bail while she appealed her 10-to-23-month sentence. The state Supreme Court announced Monday that it had declined to take up her case.
"Given that the rationale for (the) defendant remaining at liberty pending appeal has expired, post-sentence bail is revoked,&#x201D; Judge Wendy Demchick-Alloy write in ordering Kane to report to the Montgomery County Correctional Facility. Demchick-Alloy formally directed the Lackawanna County sheriff to serve a copy of her order on Kane, who lives in Scranton.
