Democrat T.J. Cox pulled ahead of Republican U.S. Rep. David Valadao following an updated vote count Monday in one of the last House race to be decided the election season.
Cox, who had trailed since election night, pulled ahead by 438 votes in the 21st Congressional District that cuts through four counties in the state's interior farm belt.
The Associated Press had declared the three-term lawmaker, Valadao, the winner but votes that have been counted since Nov. 6 steadily narrowed the race, and the AP retracted its race call after Cox took the lead.
