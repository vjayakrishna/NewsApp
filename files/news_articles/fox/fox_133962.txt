"The Walking Dead" has hit a new midseason finale ratings low for the second year in a row.
The episode that aired this Sunday, the midseason finale for the show&#x2019;s ninth season, averaged a 2.0 rating in adults 18-49 and 5.1 million viewers, according to Nielsen Live+Same Day data. The Season 8 midseason finale was previously the lowest-rated, with that episode having drawn a 3.4 rating and 7.9 million viewers last year. That means this year&#x2019;s midway point for the show was down a steep 41 percent in the key demo and 35 percent in total viewers compared to the same episode last year. This season&#x2019;s episode is also now not only the lowest-rated midseason finale for the show to date, but also its least-watched.
The midseason finale ratings for the show now rank as follows, organized from highest-rated to lowest.
