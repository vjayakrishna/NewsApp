BETHESDA, Md. – A report of an active shooter Tuesday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington was a "genuine false alarm," a spokesman said.
Naval Support Activity Bethesda spokesman Jeremy Brooks said officials at the Maryland base were looking into what caused the report.
NSAB tweeted at 2:15 p.m. that an active shooter had been reported in the basement of a building. The all clear came about an hour later, after security found "no indication" of an active shooter, according to NSAB.
