Catherine Zeta-Jones says the secret behind her lasting union with Michael Douglas is having &#x201C;a very open relationship.&#x201D;
The 49-year-old Welsh actress told &#x201C;Today&#x201D; hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb Tuesday that being completely candid with her husband of nearly 20 years has made their relationship work despite maintaining Hollywood careers and being faced with public scandal.
&#x201C;First of all, I&#x2019;m so happy that we&#x2019;ve made it 20 years together,&#x201D; said Zeta-Jones. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been great, but I think it&#x2019;s just unfathomable to me that you would be with one person for 18 years and things are not rosy every day. They&#x2019;re just not.
