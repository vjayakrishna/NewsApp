BETHESDA, Md. – A drill was being conducted Tuesday afternoon when an active shooter was reported at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington, the U.S. Navy said.
Naval Support Activity Bethesda gave the all clear on the Maryland base that houses the military hospital after security found "no indication" of an active shooter.
The NSAB tweeted at 2:15 p.m. that an active shooter had been reported in the basement of a building. Public affairs officer Jeremy Brooks told AP by phone that all traffic had been stopped in or out of the facility. The all clear came about an hour later, after security found no shooter.
