Meghan Markle&#x2019;s estranged half-sister Samantha spent Thanksgiving with their father Thomas after she failed to reconnect with the Duchess of Sussex.
The 53-year-old took to Twitter over the weekend to share photos of her posing with the 74-year-old former Hollywood lighting director.
&#x201C;Had a fantastic birthday and Thanksgiving with my dad!&#x201D; captioned Samantha in one of the selfies, as reported by UK&#x2019;s Daily Mail.
