GENEVA – Switzerland's civil aviation authority said it will question a hang-glider pilot after a tourist he flew over a picturesque Swiss landscape nearly fell dozens of meters (yards) to the ground because his harness wasn't properly attached.
A nail-biting video of the incident drew more than 1.4 million views on YouTube by Tuesday, a day after it was posted.
The video edit titled "Swiss Mishap" starts with a written introduction and then zooms in on the two men, with a note that the passenger's harness isn't attached. After a countdown and running to a takeoff, the passenger dangles to the pilot's left, variously clinging to the bar or to the pilot's clothes.
