SALT LAKE CITY – A man who was a passenger in a car that fatally rammed a police officer in a Salt Lake City suburb has been arrested on suspicion of murder, burglary and other charges, police said.
As suspect Jeffrey Don Black, 43, was being led away in handcuffs Monday night from a police station, he insisted he didn't know a person had been killed.
"I didn't know it was a cop. I thought it was a mailbox," he said before expressing his sympathy about the death.
