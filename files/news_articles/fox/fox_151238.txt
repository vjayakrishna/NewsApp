BUENOS AIRES, Argentina – Argentine authorities say that Buenos Aires will be an armored city when world leaders arrive for this week's G-20 summit. But security failures that marred a soccer championship and deeper unrest over an economic austerity program are now raising concerns about the country's ability to ensure safety.
About 22,000 police and security agents will guard U.S. President Donald Trump and other leaders from the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging nations during the two-day meeting that starts Friday. At least another eight U.S. aircraft and up to 400 American military personnel and civilians are expected to provide security.
"We're working on every detail," said Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich, at a press conference addressing G-20 concerns. "We don't have disagreements, and even less so in these types of operations where we work in teams."
