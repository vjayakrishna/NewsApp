Staff at a Texas detention camp holding thousands of migrant children were not undergoing FBI fingerprint checks and the Trump administration waived stringent background check requirements for employees at the facility, a government watchdog memo said Tuesday.
The tent city in Tornillo, Texas, was not conducting FBI background checks for staff at the facility as of late September, the memorandum from the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General said Tuesday.
“Instead, Tornillo is using checks conducted by a private contractor that has access to less comprehensive data, thereby heightening the risk that an individual with a criminal history could have direct access to children,” the memo said.
