It’s the largest economic development project in New York state history, bringing with it up to 40,000 high-paying jobs and billions of dollars in tax revenue. But when many New Yorkers and local politicians look at Amazon’s “HQ2,” they see the problems of Seattle.
Critics have a growing list of complaints about the proposed $3.6 billion project for a second Amazon headquarters in the Queens neighborhood of Long Island City: It's being done with limited local input and will snarl the city's dilapidated subway system, they say, cause more congestion on the already slow-moving city streets, make rents and apartment prices spike, increase income inequality and lead to more homelessness. All while Amazon enjoys billions of dollars in incentives with limited regional oversight.
The initial outrage toward the deal has not given way to quiet acceptance. On Monday, protesters entered Amazon’s store in Manhattan to voice opposition to the development.
