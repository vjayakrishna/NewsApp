LONDON — Migrants are attempting the 21-mile journey across the English Channel from France to Britain aboard flimsy inflatable boats, canoes and even water scooters.
Video footage that aired on "Good Morning Britain" Tuesday showed U.K. authorities picking up nine people who had attempted to traverse one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes in a rubber dinghy. Those rescued included four children.
More than 100 migrants have attempted the crossing in the past three weeks, according to British media reports.
