President Donald Trump threatened in a tweet Tuesday to cut off all government subsidies to General Motors, including electric cars, following the company's announcement of layoffs and plant closures. But he didn't spell out whether he had any political support for the move, nor whether any specific protocol existed for carrying out that threat.
"Very disappointed with General Motors and their CEO, Mary Barra, for closing plants in Ohio, Michigan and Maryland," the president tweeted.
"Nothing being closed in Mexico &amp; China. The U.S. saved General Motors, and this is the THANKS we get! We are now looking at cutting all @GM subsidies, including for electric cars. General Motors made a big China bet years ago when they built plants there (and in Mexico) — don’t think that bet is going to pay off. I am here to protect America’s Workers!"
