HOUSTON — The mother of a toddler who died weeks after being released from the nation's largest family detention center filed a legal claim seeking $60 million from the U.S. government for the child's death.
Attorneys for Yazmin Juárez submitted the claim against multiple agencies Tuesday. Juárez 's 1-year-old daughter, Mariee, died in May.
Juárez 's lawyers said Mariee developed a respiratory illness while she and her mother were detained at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. They accused U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of releasing the pair while Mariee was still sick.
