Christine Blasey Ford, the California professor who testified that now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, said last week that “coming forward was terrifying" but gave her the chance "to fulfill my civic duty."
Blasey Ford also wrote that money raised on her behalf through a GoFundMe campaign had been more than enough to ensure security for her and her family and that she will donate unused funds to organizations that help trauma survivors.
“Although coming forward was terrifying, and caused disruption to our lives, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to fulfill my civic duty,” Blasey Ford wrote on the GoFundMe page. “Having done so, I am in awe of the many women and men who have written me to share similar life experiences, and now have bravely shared their experience with friends and family, many for the first time.”
