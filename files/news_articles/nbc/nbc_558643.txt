JACKSON, Miss. — Racial tension permeates the air in this state like humidity — thick and stifling at certain times, less noticeable at others, but always present.
Right now, it hangs heavily over Tuesday's special election runoff — polls are open and close at 8:00 p.m. ET — for the remaining two years of retired Sen. Thad Cochran's term, a contest that pits white Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith against Democrat Mike Espy, a black former congressman and U.S. agriculture secretary.
Hyde-Smith ensured that racial issues would be a consideration when she was captured on video earlier this month saying that she would be "on the front row" if one of her supporters was somehow involved with a "public hanging" and invited her to attend.
