A man's first time hang gliding in Switzerland turned into a terrifying ordeal after he realized he hadn't been strapped in before take off.
Chris Gursky was on the first day of a vacation to Switzerland when he decided to go hang gliding. He filmed what was expected to be a serene flight over Swiss forests and greenery, and instead turned into a nail-biting two minutes.
A video of the flight, which was posted to YouTube on Monday, has since been viewed more than 1.3 million times.
