National security adviser John Bolton said Tuesday he had no need to listen to recordings taken during the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
"What do you think I'll learn from it?” Bolton asked reporters at the White House. “Unless you speak Arabic, what are you going to get from it?"
“People who speak Arabic have listened to the tape and given us the substance of what is in it. We’re very satisfied that we know what the tape picked up, and it was factored into the president’s position,” he continued.
