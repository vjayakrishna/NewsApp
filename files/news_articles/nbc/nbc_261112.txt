Two more premature babies who were in the neonatal intensive care unit at a New Jersey hospital died last week, bringing to three the number who have died after a bacterial outbreak at the facility in September, the state Health Department announced Tuesday.
The two babies, who were infected six weeks ago at University Hospital in Newark, died last week, but the New Jersey Department of Health said it was not notified of the deaths until Monday.
This prompted the health department to send an inspection team to the hospital Tuesday.
