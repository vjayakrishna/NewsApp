President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping will meet to discuss trade issues ahead of the G20 Summit this week in Buenos Aires, confirmed Larry Kudlow, head of the National Economic Council.
"There's a good possibility a deal can be made," Kudlow said at a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon, noting that Trump personally called Xi to "get things started."
Certain conditions still need to be met in order to resolve the standoff between the world's two largest economies, Kudlow said, including resolving intellectual property theft, forced tech transfers, and tariffs, quotas, and subsidies. Ultimately, the goal is "zero tariffs and zero subsidies," Kudlow said.
