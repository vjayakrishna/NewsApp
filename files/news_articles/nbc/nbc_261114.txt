The Ohio man accused of killing the mother of his daughter and seven members of her family with the help of his brother and parents pleaded not guilty to 23 counts on Tuesday.
Edward "Jake" Wagner, 26, was the first of his family to be arraigned in a Pike County court.
Authorities have said that a custody dispute between Wagner and his former girlfriend, Hanna Rhoden, was the motive behind the April 2016 killings of her and seven of her family members, including a teenager, on their marijuana farm.
