SAN FRANCISCO — A U.S. judge overseeing a criminal case against Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. asked the utility Tuesday to explain any role it may have played in a massive wildfire that destroyed a Northern California town and killed nearly 90 people.
Judge William Alsup in San Francisco directed PG&amp;E in a court filing to respond to a series of questions about power line safety and wildfires. He is overseeing a jury verdict and sentence against PG&amp;E after a natural gas pipeline explosion killed eight people and destroyed 38 homes in the San Francisco Bay Area eight years ago.
Investigators have not determined the cause of the wildfire that tore through the town of Paradise, destroying nearly 14,000 homes and killing at least 88 people. Speculation, however, has centered on PG&amp;E, which reported an outage around the time and place the fire ignited.
