‘Tis better to give than to receive, so why not go the extra mile to find a gift  for your loved ones that works overtime, paying it forward to an important charity?
From kid-friendly  accessories to alcohol to stock the holiday bar, there are a wide variety of covetable gifts that will do more than delight your recipient: they’ll give back to those less fortunate, too. Here are some of our favorite picks, many of which are from companies who aren’t simply donating money during the holiday season, but supporting worthy initiatives year-round.
BETTER editors, writers and experts take care to recommend items we really like and hope you’ll enjoy! Just so you know, BETTER does have affiliate relationships. So, while every product is independently selected, if you buy something through our links, we may get a small share of the revenue.
