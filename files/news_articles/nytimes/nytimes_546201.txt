MEXICO CITY — The messages arrived at a familiar moment of crisis for Mexico’s fragile journalist community — another reporter killed in the line of duty.
Javier Valdez, a prominent investigative reporter, had been shot dead only a day earlier. Then came a sudden breakthrough: According to a text message received by his colleagues, his killers had been detained.
Despite the tragedy, his co-workers were suspicious. More than 90 percent of murders go unsolved in Mexico. How did the authorities solve the case so soon?
