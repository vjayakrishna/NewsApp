Condé Nast, the once-flush publisher of Vogue, Vanity Fair, The New Yorker and other magazines, is looking for a new business leader after years of losses.
The company said on Tuesday that its chief executive, Robert A. Sauerberg Jr., would step down after his successor was found. The announcement came months after Mr. Sauerberg announced a sweeping plan to address the struggles at Condé Nast.
A corporate restructuring will go along with the change in leadership. The next person to fill the top job will hold the title of global chief executive, a new position at the head of both Condé Nast and Condé Nast International. The two entities have historically operated as separate sister companies.
