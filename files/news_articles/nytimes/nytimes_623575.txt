HONG KONG — When the members of Bottlesmoker, an “indietronic” band from Indonesia, landed in Vietnam last Thursday, they were looking forward to their set at Quest Festival, an annual event billed as a “wondrous, wild wonderland of nature, art and eclectic entertainment.”
But just after 11 p.m. on Friday — after bands and fans had traveled to the festival site near the capital, Hanoi — the Quest organizers told Bottlesmoker by email that the event was off. “After supporting us until today the authorities have decided to withdraw our festival license for reasons that are still unknown to us,” they wrote.
“Bottlesmoker was waiting to play at Quest Festival for, like, almost two years,” Anggung Suherman, who plays synthesizers in the band, said in an interview. “So it’s really broken our hearts.”
