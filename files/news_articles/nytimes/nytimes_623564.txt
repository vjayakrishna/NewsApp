WASHINGTON — The ringleader of a group of rebellious Democrats pushing to deny Representative Nancy Pelosi the speaker’s gavel in the new Congress appeared to soften his opposition on Monday, calling for negotiations in the clearest signal to date that Ms. Pelosi’s detractors have failed to thwart her steady march to the top post.
Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who helped spearhead a letter last week in which 16 Democrats said it was time for Ms. Pelosi to stand aside, said that his effort was “bigger than her,” as Democratic aides aligned with him said that some of the defectors were searching for a deal that would ultimately allow them to vote for her.
“Leader Pelosi wants to boil this down to a personal argument, but this is so much bigger than her,” Mr. Moulton said in a statement. “It’s about the entire, stagnant, three-person leadership team and having a serious conversation about promoting leaders who reflect the future of our caucus.”
