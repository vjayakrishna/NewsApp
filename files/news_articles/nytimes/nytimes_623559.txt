On the morning of Nov. 9, a wildfire busted out of a small area outside Los Angeles, jumped Highway 101 and ignited the jagged hills of the Santa Monica Mountains. In its fiery path were thousands of homes and residents, and a mountain lion named P-74.
It was the last day P-74 was seen alive. While the wildfire, known as the Woolsey Fire, raged through the slopes and canyons over the next two weeks, scorching over 1,500 buildings and killing three people, park rangers in the Santa Monica Mountains searched for GPS signals from about a dozen mountain lions constantly tracked there. All of them were eventually located alive except for P-74, a roughly one-year-old male and the newest member of the group.
On Monday, rangers in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, a vast area of trails and parks on federal land overlooking the Pacific Ocean, confirmed what they had feared was true: P-74 likely died in the blaze. His GPS collar last sent a signal at 1 p.m. on Nov. 9, but failed to register at the next automatic check-in, at 5 p.m. that same day.
